# Odin Recipes Project

This is my take on the recipes project assigned in the Fundamentals Unit of the
Odin Project, a free online course to learn web development.  I do not enjoy
cooking, so instead of doing food recipes I thought I would explain three
LeetCode recipes.  That is, three techniques you can use to solve some problems
on LeetCode.

* Two Pointer Method
* Sliding Window Method
* Fast/Slow Pointers

This project requires the **manim** library to generate images using Python.
The scripts to generate these images will be found in the `./manim` directory.
